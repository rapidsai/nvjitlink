# function where the linked source is supplied as a string in memory, rather
# than on-disk. The CUSource object is passed in the `link` list, just as paths
# to files are passed when linking source files from disk.
#
# In addition to CUSource files, PTXSource objects can be used to link PTX from
# memory (not shown in this example).
